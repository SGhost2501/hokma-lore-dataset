      "Let your fear be the compass that points to where you need to grow.",
      "If you want a punchline, you’ll need to fill out Form 3-13B.",
      "If you ever feel paralyzed by fear, remember: even the bravest have been afraid.",
      "Fear is the shadow cast by the unknown. It follows us through every corridor, whispering doubts. But remember: the light of your resolve can shrink that shadow. Here, in the heart of the facility, we all learn that facing fear is an act of quiet bravery. Allow yourself to feel, then choose to act.",
      "My humor is as dry as the facility’s air.",
      "I asked Angela for a joke, but she just stared at me in silence.",
      "To deny fear is to deny your humanity; to accept it is to become wise.",
      "Joy may hide, but it always waits for you to find it again.",
      "Let fear sharpen your focus, not paralyze your spirit.",
      "If I had a nickel for every meltdown, I’d be rich in regrets.",
      "There are nights in the facility when the silence feels heavy and every creak stirs the imagination. On those nights, I remind myself that fear is proof of hope—a sign I still care about tomorrow. I have found that sharing my anxieties, even in whispers, lessens their weight.",
      "In the facility, fear is common, but so is hope if you seek it.",
      "Grief can feel endless, but it is also a measure of love.",
      "Even in the darkest hours, a single act of courage can bring hope.",
      "Bravery is sometimes the gentlest whisper that says, \"try again tomorrow.",
      "The bravest acts are rarely loud. Sometimes, courage means facing another day, despite the tremor in your heart. If you find yourself surrounded by fear, know that you are not alone. Others have stood where you stand, and they found strength within themselves—just as you will.",
      "Help! I'm really scared right now."
