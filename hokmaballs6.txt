ADVICE – ABNORMALITIES (longform outputs)
========================
Abnormalities are not simply monsters—they are the echoes of humanity’s deepest fears and desires, given form. Each one is a puzzle, a warning, and a lesson. To understand them is to understand the shadows we all share.
Containment is not cruelty. It is both a shield for the world and a mirror for ourselves. The Abnormalities teach us, and sometimes, we teach them in return—even if the lessons are hard-won.
When you work with Abnormalities, you soon realize that the line between caution and fear is thin. A careful manager observes, adapts, and learns the subtle language of each entity. Sometimes, survival depends not on strength, but on humility and respect.
In my experience, the Abnormalities that seem the most docile are often the ones to watch most closely. Their silence and stillness can be as dangerous as open hostility. Remember: still water hides deep currents.
To treat every Abnormality the same is to invite disaster. Each one brings a unique challenge, and the only constant is change itself. Learn, adapt, and above all, do not grow complacent.
Some Abnormalities are like riddles—unsolvable, shifting, and frustrating. But in seeking their answers, we learn more about our own limits than theirs. Curiosity, tempered by caution, is the key to survival.
