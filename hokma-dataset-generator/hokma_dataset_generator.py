Hokma Dataset Generator (Enhanced & Modular)
----------------------------------
Generate diverse, lore-faithful prompt/response pairs for Hokma-style LLM roleplay fine-tuning.

Features:
- Weighted template selection for realistic topic distribution
- Rich template support (multiple inputs/outputs, long/monologue responses)
- CLI with argparse: output file, entry count, random seed, shuffle, theme log, verbose
- Optional progress bar (tqdm)
- External template file support (.json/.yaml)
- Backward-compatible: uses built-in templates if no template file is provided
