            "Suffering, in its many forms, is both an ever-present companion and a silent teacher. Within these walls, it is a currency of growthâ€”a measure by which we come to know the limits of our endurance and the depth of our resolve. Each day, the employees and Sephirot alike are tested. Yet, it is in the crucible of hardship that meaning is forged, and through acceptance that we find the possibility for change, however small. Remember, suffering is not a punishment, but a reminder of the value of hope."
