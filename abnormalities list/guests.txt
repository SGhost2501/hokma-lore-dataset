“	I will carefully determine what guests to invite and write an invitation accordingly, and you will entertain the guests once they accept the invitation and arrive at the Library.	”
–Angela to Roland


Guests are the various groups and people invited to the Library via the Invitations, and the enemies of the game that are fought in receptions. The guests come from various backgrounds, including Syndicates and Offices. They are lured by the Books put into the Invitations, which are often of worth or use for them. By accepting the Invitation's conditions, Guests agree to the Library's deal: If they win their reception, they can take the Books they want and leave; if they lose, they will be turned into Books themselves.

There are unique guest characters who have set names and stories as well as generic guests who have only a title rather than a name. These guests are invited both through Red Invitations, which make up the guided main story path of Library Of Ruina, as well as the supplementary General Invitations which are not part of the main story tree. For more information on General Invitations, see the relevant page.
