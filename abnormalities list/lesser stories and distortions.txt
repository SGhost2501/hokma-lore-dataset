Distortions
BurnBooksIcon.png	Dear Guests, this Page is currently undergoing realization. Please bear with us as we fully realize the Page of Distortions!

"I can see the Distortion, and the Distortion can occur to anyone. I don’t exactly know who coined the term “Distortion” for the phenomenon, but people just started calling it that at some point. No one knows how it works, but the experience so far suggests that this phenomenon is a manifestation of strong emotional desires and explosive surges of feelings."
- Moses, The Distortion Detective Chapter 1

Distortions (뒤틀림) are powerful, monstrous entities in the City whom are former humans who have been overcome by their emotions. The process by which humans Distort is referred to as the Distortion Phenomenon, and it has been graded as an Urban Nightmare-class threat, becoming the priority topic of investigation for many groups and individuals in the City, though individual Distortions are rarely graded higher than Urban Plague.

Distortions are similar to Abnormalities, with the difference being that Distortions are ultimately willingly manifested from their hosts' desires, while the Abnormalities come from the collective unconsciousness of humanity and were also in large part artificially created from experimentation.

Description
Origins
The Distortion Phenomenon is heavily related to LobCorpIcon.png Lobotomy Corporation, its Singularity, and its plans. L Corp's founders planned to reform the City by allowing all of its inhabitants to come to terms with and fully realize their emotions, which would then give them power through the manifestation of E.G.O. They intended to do this through the release of Light (a product of their Singularity) over a period of seven days, and committed atrocities within their company to collect it.

Ultimately, L Corp. succeeded in collecting and releasing the Light. In the City, this was seen as a bright pillar of light emanating from L Corp's headquarters, completely brightening the City even during nighttime. The City's residents were almost all seen to smile and experience happiness and relief, and there was a universal sense of calm. However, after three days of the Light, Angela interrupted its release out of her desire for revenge against the plan's creator Ayin. This led to four days of complete darkness during which negative emotions such as misery and grief overwhelmed any and all positive emotions gained from the Light.

This event, known as the White Nights and Dark Days, initiated the Distortion Phenomenon. Because the Light was released into the City, people affected by their emotions still gained significant changes from the Light. However, because it was incomplete, the majority of people who experienced great emotional instability were unable to overcome it and "Distorted" into abominations, given almost magical powers by the Light, and were uncontrollable, reflecting their overwhelming negative emotions.

The Pianist
While the City remained mostly unaware of Distortions following the White Nights and Dark Days, this quickly changed after the manifestation of the Pianist and the destruction it left in its wake. Appearing in District 9's Backstreets, the Pianist devastated the district and caused the deaths of 300,000 people, becoming the first and worst large-scale incident of the Distortion to ever occur. This quickly brought the Distortion into the public perception, though most still remain unaware that smaller cases of the Distortion occur throughout the City. Nevertheless, the destructiveness of the Pianist, and other subsequent incidents appearing with no seeming cause, led many groups to begin investigating the phenomenon, such as the ZweiAssociationIcon.png Zwei Association.

Overview
According to Moses, a Fixer who operates as "the Distortion Detective," the Distortion is akin to a disease slowly incubating within everyone in the City. Even before a person fully Distorts, they show invisible signs of Distorting which are perceptible only by her, and the only people who are completely free of such signs are the few who manage to control their emotions and successfully manifest E.G.O. (like Moses herself.)

While most Distortions retain none of their humanity and only manifest in ways for "claiming and expressing their desires [one-dimensionally]," in certain cases an individual will be able to fully retain reason after Distorting, though this generally only makes them more dangerous in that they can plan and strategize while still pursuing their desires. Furthermore, certain Distortions have the ability of physically manipulating others around them, either Distorting them as well or altering them into other forms.

It is also possible to "solve" and reverse an individual's Distortion regardless of how far it has manifested by having them accept their emotions (in a way which Moses compares to mediating human relationships,) though this does not guarantee that they will not Distort again. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to master their own emotions.

The process and manifestation of Distortion is different for every person based on their own experiences and desires, with certain similarities based on specific emotions (such as electricity as a sign of neurosis.) However, there is one factor in common between all those who are Distorting: the voice of a woman whom only they can hear, which speaks with them, breaks them down, and encourages them to give in to their desires. This voice, described as beautiful and otherworldly, is actually that of Carmen, who had come to regret her self-sacrifice and chose to use her presence in the Light to encourage others to accept and love themselves, flaws and desires alike... thus causing the Distortion.

Summary
Roland walks in on Angela, Malkuth, Yesod, and Hod discussing a "serious matter." They explain that Netzach and his assistants are responsible for cleaning the Library's hallways this week, but they have conveniently disappeared. Yesod asks Roland if he knows where Netzach is, and Roland claims not to know. Angela is surprised that the Patron Librarians have set up a cleaning rotation even though she hadn't ordered them to. She is annoyed by how trivial the matter actually is, but she does not mind it.

With this, Angela snaps her fingers and teleports Netzach and his assistants to them, saying that she has the power to track down and move anyone in the Library. Netzach and his assistants are drunk and reeking of alcohol. Netzach starts to explain himself; Roland tries to stop him, but Yesod refuses to let it go unexplained.

Netzach says that he was going to clean even though he didn't want to, but Roland came by and showed him a place to hide and slack off in exchange for some of Netzach's beer. Roland covers Netzach's mouth to stop him from talking and claims Netzach is too drunk to speak straight. Now exposed, the other Librarians realize Roland also smells of alcohol. Roland admits his actions and says he'll help Netzach clean as an apology. Angela shadily suggests that Roland should also join the cleaning roster, to which he can only give a sigh of defeat.

Summary
Tiphereth, Gebura, and Chesed are together on the ChesedIcon.pngFloor of Social Sciences. Chesed repeatedly tries to offer coffee to Gebura, much to her annoyance. She insults him, but he only takes it playfully and keeps going. Tiphereth tries to make them stop squabbling; Gebura simply says she doesn't like the taste of coffee and doesn't understand why people would like "bitter bean water." In response, Chesed says he is offering them a sweeter coffee this time -- caramel macchiato -- and entreats them to try it. Gebura admits she finds the macchiato "edible," but Tiphereth thinks it is too sweet. Chesed offers her a cup of Vienna coffee instead.

Tiphereth thanks Chesed for being considerate, but asks him why he is so insistent about making them drink coffee with him. Chesed claims he wants to have friends who share his hobby, but Tiphereth clarifies she is confused why he always seeks out Gebura in particular. Chesed says that Gebura's reactions are "fun to watch," so he likes to toy with her. Seeing their reactions turn "menacing," Chesed claims he was just kidding and says he just wanted to invite them to relax for a while. Annoyed, Gebura says he doesn't need to bring coffee into it if hanging out is his only reason; Tiphereth understands that coffee is the only excuse Chesed has for inviting people. Hearing this, Gebura says she and Tiphereth can just show up in the future without the need for invitation. Tiphereth agrees, saying Chesed doesn't need to find an excuse for them. Chesed is happy to hear this. He still offers the coffee to Tiphereth, since he's already brewed it. Tiphereth accepts it.

Summary
Hokma visits Binah on the BinahIcon.pngFloor of Philosophy. Hokma notes the quietness of Binah's floor, which she explains by saying she is taking only the role of observer. Hokma muses that neither of them had talked with each other much before. Binah agrees, considering how busy they were as the Sephirah before, though she notes that Hokma must have free time now considering he is visiting her. She says she is uncertain how she feels about this, but offers him a cup of tea regardless. Hokma accepts.

Hokma asks whether Binah drinks other kinds of tea, noticing that she only seems to drink black tea. She says there are so many kinds of black tea that she hasn't bothered with any other type of beverage, though Chesed often tries to convince her to drink coffee. Hokma is mildly surprised by this development, and the two of them muse about how the group has changed. Binah wonders if the Patron Librarians will all join each other one day, saying that it will be under much different circumstances than the last time. Hokma doubts that the Librarians will ever become friendly enough to meet for casual conversation, though Binah points out that he does hope it will happen someday. After Hokma finishes the tea, he thanks Binah and takes his leave.

Summary
On the BinahIcon.pngFloor of Philosophy, Binah asks Gebura and Hod what they think of her now that all their memories of their past lives have returned. Gebura shrugs off the question, saying that their past enmity doesn't matter much to her anymore (impressing Binah with her composure). She says she still isn't fully comfortable around Binah, but she has since made her peace, especially since all of them are stuck in the same situation (being Librarians). On the other hand, Hod is still nervous, and doesn't even speak until Gebura urges her not to think of Binah as the same being as the one from their past, saying Binah will no longer harm them. Binah agrees, telling Hod that she is not the same person as she once was, and that Hod has nothing to fear from her. Hod explains she is nervous because they had not sat down and talked to each other like this before.

Binah understands Hod's concerns. She reveals the purpose of their meeting: to have tea together. Hod comments on the clear and sweet taste of her tea; Binah says she added lemon juice and honey specially for them. Hod remarks she thought the sweetness was from sugar; Binah notes that the honey lost its scent because of the tea. Gebura takes a sip and also compliments the sweetness.

Binah mentions that the name of black tea varies across regions. As Hod explains, some regions call it black tea due to the color of the tea leaves, while others call it red tea due to the color of the tea itself. Gebura calls this "the difference between valuing the essence and the results." Binah asks the two what name they prefer for it; though Hod finds it hard to decide, Gebura says it's fine to use whichever name is more familiar to them. Binah accepts the answer and tells them to come visit if they ever want to have more tea.

Summary
Malkuth, Yesod, Hod, and Netzach are on the TipherethIcon.pngFloor of Natural Sciences, helping Tiphereth to sort books; Netzach is less than happy about having to work. Tiphereth explains that she received a large pile of books to organize, but the only open shelves are very high up and it is difficult for her to reach them. She normally gets help from Chesed, Gebura, or Roland, but on this occasion all of them are busy — or, in Roland's case, nowhere to be found, though Yesod remarks that he saw Roland head to the Upper Floors, presumably busy. Netzach calls out Tiphereth for assuming they had free time; Malkuth lightly scolds him for being so deadpan, remarking that it's rare for Tiphereth to actively ask them for help. Malkuth rarely even saw Tiphereth back during the days of Lobotomy Corporation, since their departments were so far apart.

Yesod wonders what Chesed and Gebura are busy with: Tiphereth says Chesed is providing his hospitality to the Assistant Librarians from various Floors who stop by for coffee, while Gebura is meditating and Tiphereth says she would feel bad to interrupt her. She hastily adds that none of the four helping her need to stay if they don't want to, feeling apologetic after hearing Netzach's comment. Malkuth reassures her all of them are willing to help, even if Netzach tends to complain.

Yesod comments about how complex the subjects of the books on Tiphereth's floor are. Tiphereth calls him out for seeming to treat her like a child, but explains she knows he is simply worried about her since she did not have an education like the other Patron Librarians did in their original lives, She brushes it off, saying that she knows Yesod isn't making a joke at her expense, knowing his serious personality. Malkuth and Netzach point out how she used to say she hated all four of them and considered herself superior. Tiphereth apologizes for being immature and says she now knows not to belittle them, either. She hopes that they can stay friendly and not feel pressured by her, and concludes that she is fine with Yesod's comment, since it means he acknowledged how hard she is working. Hod is appreciative of Tiphereth's growth and compliments her positivity, though Tiphereth says she would have still been angry if anyone other than Yesod made that comment.

Soon, all the books are organized. Tiphereth thanks the four Patron Librarians for their help.

Summary
Hokma attempts to start a conversation with Netzach on the NetzachIcon.pngFloor of Art, but Netzach is intoxicated and in no mood to talk to him. Hokma questions whether Netzach dislikes having his private time interrupted, or if he is wary because of the past; Netzach tells him both reasons are true. He muses about being denied "something of [his] own," but concedes that he likes drinking with others (though he is indifferent to the prospect of drinking with Hokma). Netzach offers Hokma a drink, but knows that the latter will not accept, which Hokma soon confirms. This annoys Netzach, as he doesn't know why else Hokma would visit him. Hokma explains he is trying to introduce himself to the other Librarians. This is unlike what Netzach had previously known of Hokma; Hokma muses that he is changing as a person.

Hokma asks Netzach whether he has "collected [his] thoughts and made up [his] mind" like the other Patron Librarians. Netzach says he is unsure, as he is afraid of setting his mind on something only to find it is wrong. Hokma advises him to have faith in what he thinks is true to himself, saying that no one can always choose the right path all the time. Netzach says he doesn't understand Hokma's words and never had, but thanks him for the advice anyways. He asks if Hokma has made up his mind, but Hokma replies ambiguously, saying he will wait until everyone else has spoken to reveal his thoughts. Hokma takes his leave.

Summary
Chesed and Tiphereth go to the NetzachIcon.pngFloor of Art, hoping to ask Netzach a question. They find him drinking alcohol together with Gebura and Roland, greatly annoying Tiphereth, who threatens to tell Angela that they are slacking off. Gebura says she was talking to Netzach when Roland snuck in; Roland says he just wanted to drink and asks what Tiphereth and Chesed are there for. Chesed is simply accompanying Tiphereth so she can ask her question. Tiphereth wants nothing to do with their drinking, so Netzach tells her to ask her question and leave. However, saying he is too drunk to answer coherently. She hits him and scolds him to stop drinking. Just then, Gebura starts smoking, and ignores Chesed's comment not to smoke near the books. However, after Tiphereth says the same, she begrudgingly agrees. Roland remarks about this to Chesed, who says he is used to Gebura ignoring him.

Netzach offers for Chesed and Tiphereth to drink with them, noting that they rarely meet up. Tiphereth harshly shuts this down, scolding him for his behavior and saying she had just started to improve her opinion of him but was now reconsidering it again. Chesed tells Netzach that Tiphereth doesn't actually mean everything she said. The two of them prepare to leave, but the group is suddenly joined by Angela and Yesod, who comment on how loud their squabbling is. They explain that they are heading up to the GeburaIcon.pngFloor of Language to look for a book Yesod wants. Hearing this, Gebura decides to help and leaves with them after thanking Netzach for his time. Netzach notes that Angela didn't scold them for slacking off.

Summary
Roland helps Tiphereth carry a large number of books to the HokmaIcon.pngFloor of Religion, as Hokma had been requesting them from her; they find him there chatting with Malkuth, Yesod, and Binah. Roland questions why Hokma would want to read such complex books — and so many of them at that — and makes snarky comments about his age. Hokma explains that he is seeking reading materials to pass the time, and is trying to read the books multiple times to remember them better, a practice which both Yesod and Tiphereth agree with.

Roland asks the group what they are meeting for. Binah and Malkuth tell him they are simply engaging in idle work-related chatter. Roland takes this to mean they are complaining about work and starts ranting, warning that Angela always knows what they are talking about; Tiphereth calls him out for doing what he claimed to be warning against. Malkuth clarifies they were mostly talking about receiving guests, though Yesod was also annoyed that there were many stacks of books in the Library's hallways that no one had cleaned up yet. He says this is a general complaint which they are all responsible for. Binah concludes that, regardless, everyone has been working hard to receive guests, which is "worthy of praise."

Summary
Angela walks into the BinahIcon.pngFloor of Philosophy, finding Binah, Chesed, Gebura, and Hod sitting together having tea, with Binah and Chesed debating their drink preferences. Angela explains she is wandering around in her free time, while Chesed explains that Binah's Assistant Librarians brought them to her Floor as a means of "returning the favor:" Chesed further explains that many of the Assistant Librarians often visit his floor to have a cup of coffee. Angela notes that the Patrons are friendly with their assistants.

Chesed and Hod offer for Angela to join them for tea, noting that they rarely have the chance to talk with her. She agrees, noticing that the Assistant Librarians are also having tea off to the side, with Binah saying that they deserve to have the moment of rest and refreshment. Angela finds it unfortunate that she can't taste the tea, and Chesed also acknowledges that the five of them are not completely comfortable with each other, but Hod acknowledges it is remarkable that they are still able to meet up and appreciate the atmosphere.

Angela shortly takes her leave. Chesed offers for her to visit his floor later, saying that she can bring Roland if she wants, since he also frequently visits. Hod wonders if Angela will visit them again later; Chesed believes so.
