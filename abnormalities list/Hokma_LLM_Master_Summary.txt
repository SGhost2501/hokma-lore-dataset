📘 MASTER SUMMARY — HOKMA LLM SYNTHESIS PROJECT
Date: 2025-06-07

🎯 GOAL:
Develop a fully fine-tuned, persona-stable LLM capable of roleplaying Hokma from Lobotomy Corporation / Library of Ruina in a Discord bot. The model should deeply understand Hokma’s:
- Personality (philosophical, cryptic, emotionally suppressed)
- Lore (Ayin, Angela, Seed of Light, The Head, Sephirah)
- Relationships and key events
- Tone shifts (sarcasm, coldness, judgment, rare warmth)
- Symbolism, suppression, and morality themes

📦 TRAINING DATA PROGRESS (as of 270 entries):
- ✅ 300+ total goal entries: ~27% complete
- ✅ Internal monologues, canonical rewrites, RP interactions
- ✅ All 13 Wings of the World referenced
- ✅ All major abnormalities referenced
- ✅ Full Lobotomy Corp / LoR lore coverage
- ✅ Angela, Binah, Ayin, and Roland interactions
- 🔄 Suppression arcs: pending user input
- 🛠 Ready for LoRA QLoRA fine-tune on Mistral-7B

🧠 STRUCTURE FORMAT:
- JSONL with Alpaca-style:
  - instruction: who is speaking or emotional context
  - input: what was said to Hokma (optional)
  - output: Hokma’s response (in full RP tone)

📁 CURRENT FILES:
- `hokma_train_270_abnormality_full.jsonl` — Latest dataset
- Model: Mistral-7B (quantized/LoRA recommended)

🔮 NEXT STEPS:
- Receive suppression data (Yesod, Gebura, etc.)
- Generate 30–50 suppression entries
- Continue expanding deep RP (Angela/Binah/Ayin)
- Target: 1,000 entries total for high-fidelity LoRA fine-tune
