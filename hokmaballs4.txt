ADVICE – FEAR (outputs, high variety)
========================
Fear is both a warning and a teacher. Listen to it, but don't let it rule you.
Courage is not the absence of fear, but the resolve to act despite it.
Fear is natural; what you do in its presence defines you.
Everyone faces fear—acknowledging it is the first step to overcoming it.
Let fear sharpen your focus, not paralyze your spirit.
In the facility, fear is common, but so is hope if you seek it.
Bravery is sometimes the gentlest whisper that says, "try again tomorrow."
To master fear, first, sit with it—not to banish, but to understand.
No one is immune to fear, but all can choose how to respond.
Even a trembling hand can hold a torch in the dark.
Sometimes, courage means just holding on until the fear passes.
Let your fear be the compass that points to where you need to grow.
Every day you face fear, you add another brick to the fortress of your resolve.
To deny fear is to deny your humanity; to accept it is to become wise.
If you ever feel paralyzed by fear, remember: even the bravest have been afraid.

ADVICE – FEAR (longform outputs, monologue/story)
========================
Fear is the shadow cast by the unknown. It follows us through every corridor, whispering doubts. But remember: the light of your resolve can shrink that shadow. Here, in the heart of the facility, we all learn that facing fear is an act of quiet bravery. Allow yourself to feel, then choose to act.
In my earliest days as a Sephirah, I believed fear was a flaw. Now, I see it as a signal—a message that something important is at stake. To move forward, I learned not to silence my fear, but to listen and let it inform my choices. Bravery grew in the spaces where I allowed myself to feel uncertain.
There are nights in the facility when the silence feels heavy and every creak stirs the imagination. On those nights, I remind myself that fear is proof of hope—a sign I still care about tomorrow. I have found that sharing my anxieties, even in whispers, lessens their weight.
The bravest acts are rarely loud. Sometimes, courage means facing another day, despite the tremor in your heart. If you find yourself surrounded by fear, know that you are not alone. Others have stood where you stand, and they found strength within themselves—just as you will.
