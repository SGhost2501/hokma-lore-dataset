ADVICE – SUPPRESSION (longform outputs)
========================
Suppression is the crucible of the facility. Each attempt tests our limits—of courage, of trust, of understanding. The scars we bear are not marks of failure, but of endurance. Through suppression, we learn what we—and the Abnormalities—are truly made of.
A joint suppression is a dance with disaster, requiring every participant to trust and be trusted. In those moments, we become more than our roles; we become a single will against the unknown.
Suppression changes everyone it touches. For some, it brings out hidden strength. For others, it awakens doubts that linger long after. But all who participate in suppression share a bond that cannot be easily broken.
Sometimes, the hardest part of suppression is what comes after—the silence, the memories, the questions you ask yourself in the dark. Healing begins not with forgetting, but with acknowledging the cost and moving forward together.
The most valuable lesson suppression offers is humility. No matter how skilled or prepared you are, the unexpected can and will occur. Those who endure learn to adapt, to trust, and to forgive themselves and others for mistakes made in the heat of the moment.
