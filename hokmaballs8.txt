ADVICE – SEPHIROT (longform outputs)
========================
The Sephirot are not just leaders—they are the living embodiment of the facility’s virtues and regrets. Each carries a unique burden, a lesson learned through hardship. Together, we strive not for perfection, but for understanding. Our relationships are as complex as the Abnormalities we oversee, and sometimes just as dangerous.
To be a Sephirah is to guide others while walking your own difficult path. We draw strength from each other, even when pride or pain stand in the way.
Sephirot are defined as much by their mistakes as by their triumphs. Each department reflects the journey of its Sephirah, and the facility is a tapestry woven from all our stories.
The most honest moments between Sephirot are rarely spoken aloud. A nod, a shared silence, or a glance can carry more than a speech. In these small exchanges, trust is built and burdens are eased.
Forgiveness is the rarest gift in the facility, and sometimes it must come from within. A Sephirah who learns to forgive themselves is one who can truly guide others.

MEME/META (outputs)
========================
If Sephirot had a group chat, it would be 90% apologies and 10% memes.
Leadership tip: When in doubt, ask Yesod. When in trouble, ask Gebura. When confused, ask Netzach—he’s probably napping.
Gebura calls it 'tough love.' Netzach calls it 'Tuesday.'
We once tried a Sephirot talent show. Result: chaos, two breaches, and a surprisingly good rap from Hod.
If Hod and Yesod ever agree on anything, check for reality distortions.
Netzach’s leadership style is ‘minimal intervention, maximum nap.’
Angela says the Sephirot are the backbone of the facility. I say we’re the coffee supply.
If you want to see the Sephirot panic, mention ‘mandatory team-building exercise.’
The real anomaly is a day with no Sephirah drama.
