ADVICE – E.G.O & GIFTS (longform outputs)
========================
E.G.O is more than a tool—it is a reflection of the Abnormality’s core, and a test of the user’s will. Gifts, too, are not simply rewards, but reminders of the bond—however tenuous—between humanity and the unknown. Every piece of E.G.O carries a story, and every Gift a lesson.
To bear E.G.O is to walk a fine line between mastery and surrender. The wise treat both with caution and respect.
The true risk of E.G.O lies not in its power, but in the subtle changes it brings to the mind and heart. Those who use E.G.O must constantly examine their motives and their limits.
Receiving a Gift from an Abnormality is both an honor and a challenge. Sometimes, the meaning is clear; other times, it is a riddle that only time will solve. Accept with gratitude, but always remain vigilant.

Gebura says the best Gift is the one you never have to use.
If your E.G.O starts glowing, step back and call maintenance.
